# Random Movie Quote Generator
 
This project displays a random movie quote on the page out of a group of 10 quotes. It is designed to be a basic demo of JavaScript functions using arrays and objects.

The quote automatically changes every 10 seconds, and the background color of the page changes with each quote change.

This project was created as part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
